# NFT Carbon FootPrint Calculator

## Honours project

This is a NFT transaction energy consumption calculator.

The purpose of this browser extension is to create the "NFT Carbon Footprint Calculator," an application that displays to a user the overall energy consumption of an NFT based on carbon emissions. The application will tell the user of a comparison of the kilogrammes of CO2 emissions to different equivalencies to carbon emissions consumption by utilising simply the NFT address. Each end-user of an NFT is intended to be made aware through this transparency.
